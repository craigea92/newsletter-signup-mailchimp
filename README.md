# newsletter-signup-mailchimp

## Description
I created a newsletter sign-up page using HTML and Bootstrap. Then using Node.js and npm I created a backend file (app.js) to hold the javascript connecting to the MailChimp API. Using .gitignore I have hidden the API key.

Once a user inputs their First Name, Last Name and Email their details are then saved in MailChimp.
